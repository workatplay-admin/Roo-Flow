# ADR-007: Adopt Roo-Flow + Claude-Flow 2.0 + ruv-Swarm Multi-Agent Workflow

## Status

**Proposed** - Awaiting stakeholder review and sign-off

## Context and Problem Statement

The development team requires an IDE-native interface capable of spawning, coordinating, and monitoring large multi-agent AI workflows for research, coding, quality assurance, and deployment tasks. Current single-agent solutions create bottlenecks and lack the coordination capabilities needed for complex development workflows.

### System Requirements

- **Familiar user experience**: VS Code integration to minimize onboarding friction
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale beyond single-GPU computational limits
- **Persistence**: Cross-session, long-running memory for agent state management
- **Extensibility**: Integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP) for future tool additions
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second response times for 95% of agent coordination requests
- **Privacy**: Local execution with no cloud dependencies for sensitive code

### Tool Definitions

- **Roo-Flow**: Forked VS Code extension providing IDE-native multi-agent interface with MCP server integration capabilities
- **Claude-Flow 2.0**: Orchestration runtime with 87 MCP tools and automatic topology management for agent coordination
- **ruv-Swarm**: Distributed agent coordination system supporting 1M+ experts with persistent memory and off-GPU routing

## Decision Drivers

1. **Developer productivity**: Reduce context switching between tools and interfaces
2. **System scalability**: Support for 50+ concurrent agent workflows
3. **Integration complexity**: Minimize custom integration work through standardized protocols
4. **Resource efficiency**: Optimize local computational resource usage
5. **Maintenance burden**: Reduce long-term maintenance overhead
6. **Learning curve**: Accelerate team adoption through familiar interfaces

## Considered Options

### Option A: Roo-Flow + Claude-Flow 2.0 + ruv-Swarm (Recommended)
**Architecture**: Integrated multi-layer approach with MCP protocol standardization

**Decision Logic**:
```
IF development team requires coordinated multi-agent workflows
AND IDE integration is priority requirement
AND local execution with privacy guarantees is mandatory
AND system must scale beyond single-GPU limits
THEN Roo-Flow + Claude-Flow 2.0 + ruv-Swarm provides optimal solution
```

### Option B: Vanilla Roo Code + Local Claude Agent
**Architecture**: Single-agent approach with basic IDE integration

**Rejection Rationale**: Lacks swarm orchestration capabilities and persistent memory features required for complex workflows.

### Option C: CLI-Only Claude-Flow
**Architecture**: Command-line interface without IDE integration

**Rejection Rationale**: Poor developer experience for non-terminal users and lacks VS Code integration requirements.

### Option D: Custom Electron Application
**Architecture**: Purpose-built desktop application

**Rejection Rationale**: High development and maintenance costs, unfamiliar interface increases adoption friction.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: Option A - Roo-Flow + Claude-Flow 2.0 + ruv-Swarm

### Y-Statement

In the context of IDE-native development workflows requiring coordinated AI assistance,
facing the need for scalable multi-agent orchestration with privacy guarantees,
we decided for Roo-Flow + Claude-Flow 2.0 + ruv-Swarm integration
and neglected single-agent solutions and cloud-based coordination platforms,
to achieve real-time local agent orchestration with persistent memory,
accepting increased local resource usage and initial configuration complexity,
because developer productivity gains and privacy guarantees outweigh infrastructure costs.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)
```yaml
tasks:
  - action: "Fork Roo Code to create Roo-Flow"
    owner: "Tech Lead"
    success_criteria: "VS Code extension loads without errors"
    validation: "Execute test multi-agent workflow"
    
  - action: "Register MCP servers in settings.json"
    dependencies: ["Roo-Flow fork complete"]
    configuration:
      servers:
        - name: "claude-flow"
          command: "claude-flow"
          args: ["--mcp-mode"]
          port: 8080
        - name: "ruv-swarm"
          command: "ruv-swarm"
          args: ["--mcp-server"]
          port: 8081
    success_criteria: "Both MCP servers respond to health checks"
```

### Phase 2: UI Integration (Weeks 3-4)
```yaml
tasks:
  - action: "Implement sidebar controls"
    features:
      - "Start Swarm" button
      - "Spawn N Agents" dropdown (1-20 agents)
      - "Show Logs" panel
      - "Swarm Status" metrics display
    success_criteria: "All UI controls functional and responsive"
    
  - action: "Create slash-command interface"
    examples:
      - "/spawn 5 research-agents" → "claude-flow swarm spawn 5 --mode research"
      - "/spawn 3 QA-agents" → "claude-flow swarm spawn 3 --mode QA"
    success_criteria: "Slash commands execute successfully with <3s response"
```

### Phase 3: Memory & Persistence (Weeks 5-6)
```yaml
tasks:
  - action: "Enable ruv-Swarm persistent memory"
    configuration:
      storage_backend: "local_sqlite"
      memory_retention: "30_days"
      cross_session_state: "enabled"
    success_criteria: "Agent memory persists across IDE restarts"
    
  - action: "Implement auto-topology selection"
    topologies: ["Ring", "Mesh", "Star"]
    selection_logic: "Based on agent count and task complexity"
    success_criteria: "Optimal topology selected for 90% of workflows"
```

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
- **Developer experience**: Familiar VS Code interface reduces learning curve to <1 week
- **Capability expansion**: Claude-Flow's 87 MCP tools provide comprehensive automation
- **Scalability**: ruv-Swarm removes GPU bottlenecks and supports 1M+ expert routing
- **Privacy preservation**: Local execution maintains code confidentiality
- **Cross-session continuity**: Persistent memory enables complex, multi-day workflows

### Negative Outcomes
- **Resource consumption**: Increased local RAM usage (estimated 4-8GB for typical workflows)
- **Configuration complexity**: Two-layer MCP architecture requires careful namespace management
- **Maintenance overhead**: Must track upstream Roo Code releases to prevent drift
- **Learning curve**: Team requires training on multi-agent orchestration concepts
- **Error surface**: Additional failure points through MCP server coordination

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| R001 | MCP naming conflicts between servers | Medium | High | 9 | Enforce naming convention: `mcp__server-name__tool-name` | Dev Team |
| R002 | Agent coordination latency >3s | High | Medium | 9 | Implement local caching + fallback topology | Platform Team |
| R003 | Accidental file overwrites from hooks | Medium | High | 9 | Pre-flight backup + confirmation prompts | Safety Lead |

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Agent IDE Integration
  Scenario: Developer initiates code refactoring workflow
    Given Roo-Flow extension is active in VS Code
    And Claude-Flow 2.0 orchestration server is running
    And ruv-Swarm coordination layer is initialized
    When developer executes "/spawn 3 refactor-agents"
    Then agents coordinate through ruv-Swarm mesh topology
    And consolidated refactoring suggestions appear within 3 seconds
    And agent memory persists for cross-session continuity

  Scenario: System resource management under load
    Given 15 active agent workflows are running
    When system memory usage exceeds 85%
    Then ruv-Swarm automatically throttles new agent spawning
    And existing workflows continue without interruption
    And developer receives resource constraint notification
```
